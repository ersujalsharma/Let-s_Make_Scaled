# Let’s_Make_Scaled 🚀

## Vision
**Let’s_Make_Scaled** is a long-term portfolio repository focused on building **production-grade, scalable backend systems**.  
The goal is not just to write code, but to **design, implement, deploy, and document real-world scalable applications** using core system design principles.

This repository will evolve over time, with each project demonstrating how theoretical system design concepts translate into practical, working systems.

---

## What This Repository Represents
- Real-world backend engineering mindset
- Strong focus on **scalability, reliability, and performance**
- Clean architecture with clear trade-offs
- Systems that can handle **high traffic and growth**
- Publicly deployed applications (where applicable)

---

## Planned Start Date
📅 **January 2026**

Currently focusing on strengthening system design fundamentals.  
Implementation and deployments will begin from January 2026.

## First Planned Project

### 🔗 Scalable URL Shortener (Production-Grade)
A publicly deployed URL shortening service designed to handle **millions of requests**, focusing on:

- High read throughput
- Low-latency redirects
- Horizontal scalability
- Caching strategies
- Asynchronous analytics
- Fault tolerance and reliability

**Concepts that will be demonstrated:**
- Load balancing
- Caching (Redis)
- Database indexing and sharding
- Rate limiting
- Event-driven architecture
- Eventual consistency
- Failure handling and recovery
- Observability and metrics
