# Let’s_Make_Scaled 🚀

## Vision
**Let’s_Make_Scaled** is a long-term portfolio repository focused on building **production-grade, scalable backend systems**.  
The goal is not just to write code, but to **design, implement, deploy, and document real-world scalable applications** using core system design principles.

This repository will evolve over time, with each project demonstrating how theoretical system design concepts translate into practical, working systems.

---

## What This Repository Represents
- Real-world backend engineering mindset
- Strong focus on **scalability, reliability, and performance**
- Clean architecture with clear trade-offs
- Systems that can handle **high traffic and growth**
- Publicly deployed applications (where applicable)

---

## Planned Start Date
📅 **January 2026**

Currently focusing on strengthening system design fundamentals.  
Implementation and deployments will begin from January 2026.

---

## First Planned Project

### 🔗 Scalable URL Shortener (Production-Grade)
A publicly deployed URL shortening service designed to handle **millions of requests**, focusing on:

- High read throughput
- Low-latency redirects
- Horizontal scalability
- Caching strategies
- Asynchronous analytics
- Fault tolerance and reliability

**Concepts that will be demonstrated:**
- Load balancing
- Caching (Redis)
- Database indexing and sharding
- Rate limiting
- Event-driven architecture
- Eventual consistency
- Failure handling and recovery
- Observability and metrics

---

## How Projects Will Be Structured

Each project will include:
- Problem statement
- Functional & non-functional requirements
- High-Level Design (HLD)
- Low-Level Design (LLD)
- Architecture diagrams
- API contracts
- Database schema
- Scaling strategy (from small to large traffic)
- Failure scenarios & trade-offs
- Deployment details
- Metrics & performance observations

---

## Tech Stack (Expected)
- Java / Spring Boot
- REST APIs
- Relational Databases (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
- Redis
- Messaging systems (Kafka / Queue)
- Docker & Containers
- Cloud deployment (AWS / Azure / similar)

---

## Philosophy
> **Build simple → scale thoughtfully → document everything**

This repository prioritizes:
- Clarity over complexity
- Design decisions over shortcuts
- Real engineering trade-offs over textbook answers

---

## Status
🛠️ **Planning & Learning Phase**  
🚀 Implementation begins in **2026**
